## üìã Requirements

- SiYuan Notes version `‚â• 3.3.0`

  - Apply at [123Pan Open Platform](https://www.123pan.com/openapi)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Plugin

- Or manually download `package.zip` to `{workspace}/data/plugins/` directory

### 2. Configure 123Pan

1. Open plugin settings
2. Enter **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
3. Click **Test Connection** to verify credentials
4. Configure **Remote Folder** name (default: SiYuanSync)

### 3. Select Backup Scope

Choose what to backup in "Backup Scope":

- **Workspace**: Backup both data and configuration directories (recommended)
- **Data Directory**: Backup notes data only
- **Configuration Directory**: Backup SiYuan settings only
- **Encrypted Repository**: Backup the repo directory when local encryption is enabled

- Automatically closes when complete

**Restore Snapshot:**
- **Restore Latest Snapshot**: One-click restore of most recent backup
- **Choose Snapshot**: Select specific version from history

## üí° Usage Tips

### Backup Notes

- Plugin creates a snapshot folder in 123Pan root directory
- Snapshot naming format: `{timestamp}--{type}`, e.g., `20250106-123456--manual`
- `repo` directory snapshots are stored as ZIP archives to keep binary data compact
- Large archives automatically switch to 123Pan slice uploads, bypassing the 1‚ÄØGB single-file cap
- Auto-backup tries to execute on app close; wait for upload completion if data size is large

### Progress Indicators

- **Manual operations** show detailed progress dialogs
- **Auto-backup** runs silently in the background without interruption
- Progress dialog displays:
  - Current operation step
  - Progress percentage
  - Current file being processed

### Best Practices

1. **First Use**: Recommended to do a manual backup first to verify configuration
2. **Regular Checks**: Monitor "Remote Snapshot Count" and "Last Backup Time" in settings
3. **Before Restore**: Restore operations overwrite current data - use with caution
4. **Multi-device Sync**: 123Pan supports multi-device access for cross-device data synchronization
